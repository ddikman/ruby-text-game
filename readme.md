# Ruby Text Game
This is meant as a super teeny tiny text game just to show how logic and variables can work in Ruby.

It's meant as an easy way to ease someone into programming in Ruby.

# Get started in osx
Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you don't already have it.

Then get ruby by running `brew install ruby` if you don't already have it.

Then, once you've cloned this repo, you can simply run `ruby game.rb` and get started modifying the code!

# Get started in Windows
Install [Ruby for Windows](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) using the installer.

Then you can simply open the folder where you cloned this repo and run `ruby game.rb`.

# Exiting
The game will run in a loop until you press `Ctrl+C`, you might need to press it twice to properly get out.
